# Supplied conference marks

The logo, arrow and bookmark PNGs are the user's isolated September 17, 2026 exports from **init() conf
2026**. They retain their original pixels, dimensions and alpha coverage.
`logo_small.png` is deliberately 50% opaque; do not replace it with typed text.

| Source export | Asset | Native pixels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Vector.png` | `logo_small.png` | 57 × 13 |
| `Vector (2).png` | `logo_large.png` | 197 × 46 |
| `Vector (3).png` | `left.png` | 23 × 38 |
| `Vector (1).png` | `right.png` | 23 × 38 |
| `Frame 2147219405.png` | `bookmark.png` | 29 × 29 |
| Bookmark region in `Group 2147219341.png` | `bookmark_outline.png` | 29 × 29 |
| Empty avatar region in `Profile.png` | `empty_portrait.png` | 160 × 160 |
| Fixed QR region in `Make it yours.png` | `hack_qr.png` | 222 × 222 |

`python3 scripts/generate-design-assets.py` (Pillow) packages the original alpha
planes into LVGL A8 descriptors, without resizing or tracing. The unselected
bookmark uses its exact source export, not an eroded version of the filled mark.
These brand assets are separate from dynamic attendee photos. The source MP4 and
screen mockups are not copied into firmware; see `../intro-loop.md` for the
source-derived animation and `../fonts/README.md` for licensed typography.

The empty portrait mask is the exact monochrome region x=153, y=83, w=160,
h=160 of the supplied Profile.png (no resampling). Its luminance becomes alpha
over black. It contains no personal photo or identity.

The outline bookmark is the region x=228, y=14, w=29, h=29 from
`Group 2147219341.png`. Reversing its white-over-`#161616` composite with
`alpha = round((channel - 22) * 255 / 233)` retains the exact edge coverage.
Recompositing over the source card reconstructs every channel without error.

The fixed Hack QR is the exact region x=122, y=138, w=222, h=222 of the supplied
`Make it yours.png`, including its quiet zone and edge coverage. Its luminance
becomes alpha over black, rendered with LVGL's ordinary image widget. The source
and generated crop decode to `https://drop.workos.cloud/stopwatch`; a compile-time
check prevents using this asset after the application destination changes.
Setup and personal profile codes still use LVGL's dynamic QR widget. The sample
QR in the invitation mockup is not an invitation and is not used there.

To repeat the crop extraction before packaging:

```sh
python3 scripts/generate-design-assets.py --source-designs '/path/to/init() conf 2026'
```

The script verifies `Make it yours.png` SHA-256
`8edb37c71befd7cf98c248c94e05b7770e3ff4edc95e20ef2c2ef09bb2a59ad5`
and `Group 2147219341.png` SHA-256
`5e0d5dc6b7e9ec9c684229e6102ad4c63b50f4b9f3361f8d9cec4ac8a1cfe2dd`.
