Read [hardware.md](hardware.md) and [decisions.md](decisions.md) before changing
board configuration, input handling, account behavior, or rendering. This guide
records the workflow established with the physical StopWatch; it does not assume
the device is currently attached or authenticated.

## Source, build, and upload

The active project is `firmware/factory_badge/`, using native ESP-IDF and the
factory UI stack; read [factory-stack.md](factory-stack.md). The retained Arduino
source at `firmware/devices_badge/` supplies historical tests and portable helpers.
The repository has moved between
directories; use paths relative to the checkout. Older source copies beside the
original backup are historical. They are not the working firmware or backend.

1. Check `git status` and read the relevant source. Keep unrelated work intact.
2. Use the pinned dependencies in [README.md](../README.md). Run
   `./scripts/build.sh` for firmware edits and the relevant host checks with
   `./scripts/test.sh`. Documentation-only changes need neither a rebuild nor a
   device flash.
3. If the task calls for updating the board, identify its current port with
   `arduino-cli board list`. The displayed board name can be ambiguous; the build
   scripts carry the verified board options. Close other serial consumers.
4. `./scripts/flash.sh PORT` rebuilds and uploads the normal components. Check
   successful write/hash verification, then verify the behavior on the board.
   Do not equate compilation with installation or installation with UI verification.

The build writes to `.build/firmware/`; test output also stays under `.build/`.
The scripts locate the checkout themselves and accept an `ARDUINO_CLI` override.
Host tests currently require macOS CommonCrypto, `clang++`, Python 3, and the
ArduinoJson include directory described in the README. Generated scheduler
fixtures and source hashes are disposable outputs, not source files to edit.

The voice reply app is part of the same sketch and uses the same build/flash
scripts and partition layout. Active gateway development and deployment use
`~/Developer/chan-services/apps/devices`; read that monorepo's `AGENTS.md` and
`docs/deployment.md`. [`gateway/`](../gateway/) here and the standalone
`~/Developer/devices.chan.dev` are historical source snapshots, not release
sources. Compiling firmware does not deploy a service. See [voice-replies.md](voice-replies.md)
for the service boundary, current contract, and separately dated integration
evidence.

Ordinary component uploads preserve the established NVS/file partitions and
saved user state. Do not erase flash, change the partition scheme, write security
eFuses, or use a full-device image as a routine update. A missing serial port is
not a firmware failure; check the connection and enumerate again before recovery.

The browser has a separate [first-install flow](browser-factory-install.md) for
the recognized factory layout. It requires a verified local full-flash backup and
explicit replacement confirmation; ordinary updates remain preservation-only.
Browser installation does not require Arduino. Its factory conversion still needs
physical hardware qualification, distinct from the existing update verification.

## Verification proportional to the change

The host suite covers account paging, all prior saved-style combinations, button
gestures, orientation, profile/media URL rules, storage failure handling, HTTPS
ownership, and the extracted authentication/profile scheduler. It uses synthetic
sessions and simulated services. It does not emulate physical touch, radio, or
display hardware.

The same host suite also runs voice hold/send-gate tests, transcript pagination
and action checks, the production microphone worker with a fake I2S writer, and
the production voice controller with deterministic device/service boundaries.
The controller can be checked separately with
`python3 tests/voice-controller-host/run.py`. That runner compiles the actual
`voice_reply.h`, state helper, and UI helper; it does not generate a replacement
controller. Successful output and source hashes are written to
`.build/tests/voice-controller/verification.txt` and `source-manifest.json`.
These are host results, not observations from a connected board.

Voice checks cover durable send intent before HTTP, bounded serialized text,
complete page review, fresh Send contacts, posting permission, context loss,
capture completion, cancellation, and reconciliation without automatic repost.
Transport tests separately check exact endpoint/CA configuration, bounded error
bodies, immutable bearer/idempotency headers, audio-buffer transfer and wiping,
and explicit fallback with a new recording.

For a layout/control change, check each connected account's normal and expanded
QR, the actual circular screen crop, blue account order, yellow behavior, and
both-button Settings entry with either-button return. Review the rendered faces
for clipped names and QR quiet zones. On this firmware, a style is always zero;
provider design IDs are X=0, LinkedIn=1, GitHub=2. These design IDs differ from the
blue-button page order. Do not use old 9- or 18-design capture scripts unchanged.

For persistence/auth changes, additionally check saved data immediately after
reboot, an offline boot, normal reconnection, and correct user/workspace ownership.
An unchanged reconnect should reuse avatars and skip cache rewrites. Restore the
user's selected account and normal badge at the end of a diagnostic session.

For voice changes, also verify Settings → X replies, a physical blue hold and
release, visible recording duration, review pagination, cancel/re-record, and
the return to the badge. A simultaneous pusher chord must discard capture and
return to Settings. Check that holding blue through the 30-second sample cap
cannot restart recording, and that releasing it never sends a reply. Test
network/auth loss separately from successful transcription. Existing cached
badges remain usable offline; recording for cloud transcription requires a live
session. An unavailable X inbox or missing reply permission must be shown
honestly; dictation availability is separate from permission to post.

Use host simulations for the posting path unless the user has approved a real
target and exact reply text or explicitly chooses Send on the board. Do not
publish a test reply just to complete device verification. A transcription
check can verify the record/upload/review flow without posting to X.

Diagnostics run through the same dispatch functions as the controls, but do not
measure physical button/touch timing. A main-loop maximum includes whatever work
the measurement window contains; screen capture, decode, and storage can inflate
it. Earlier polling measurements excluded network/capture work and must not be
presented as whole-system latency. USB acknowledgment time includes transport
overhead. No battery-life or real flash power-cut reliability result is established.

## USB diagnostic protocol

Use one serial connection at **115200 baud**. Send one JSON object per line.
The existing tested tools use their library's default DTR/RTS behavior; do not
force modem-line changes just to inspect the device. Opening another monitor
while uploading or capturing causes contention.

| Request | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `{"op":"status"}` | Status group plus a brief period of periodic reporting |
| `{"op":"status","reset_metrics":true}` | Begin a fresh main-loop-gap measurement |
| `{"op":"orientation"}` | Current sensor/rotation observation |
| `{"op":"button","value":"blue","remember":false}` | Diagnostic account paging; `yellow` and `both` are also accepted |
| `{"op":"provider","value":"github","remember":false}` | Select a cached provider; unconnected providers open their setup tab |
| `{"op":"badge","expanded":true}` | Expanded profile QR; `false` returns to the normal badge |
| `{"op":"capture_badge"}` | Raw RGB capture of the public badge screen |
| `{"op":"capture_voice"}` | Explicit private RGB capture of the X replies screen |
| `{"op":"refresh_profile"}` | Request real authenticated profile refreshes |
| `{"op":"reboot"}` | Normal restart, retaining saved settings |
| `{"op":"reboot","offline_once":true}` | One test boot with the radio off; the following normal reboot restores Wi-Fi |

`remember:false` prevents diagnostic selection changes from replacing saved
preferences. It is the default, but specify it explicitly in test tools. An
offline test consumes a one-shot NVS flag; it does not delete Wi-Fi credentials.

Status arrives as `DEVICE_STATUS`, `BADGE_STATUS`, `BADGE_STORE`, and orientation
lines. Parse a fresh complete group; do not combine a new connection line with
old queued badge state. `DEVICE_STATUS` includes a user identifier, so retain
only an explicit allowlist of needed fields instead of recording raw output.
`BADGE_STORE` reports counters, not profile contents. See [privacy.md](privacy.md).

Wait for the matching `BADGE_ACTION` or `BADGE_DESIGN` acknowledgment before
checking the resulting state. A historical test failed by observing queued state
before its design command completed. Track `input_presses`: physical interaction
during an automated check invalidates its comparisons. Restart markers also
invalidate a check unless the restart was expected.

For either accepted capture command, the stream is `BADGE_CAPTURE width height`,
followed by exactly `width × height × 3`
RGB bytes, then `BADGE_CAPTURE_END` or `BADGE_CAPTURE_ABORTED`. Read the binary
length exactly, not line-by-line. Reject incomplete/aborted frames and validate
dimensions. The device caps capture time and temporarily permits short USB
write waits; normal serial writes use a zero timeout to avoid input stalls from
an unread monitor. Keep captures and sanitized test reports outside Git.

`capture_badge` is restricted to the badge. `capture_voice` is restricted to
X replies and uses the same `BADGE_CAPTURE` framing and size/deadline checks.
Neither captures Wi-Fi setup or AuthKit screens. Voice captures can contain
incoming mentions, usernames, and the full draft transcript; keep them private
under `.build/`. Capturing a frame is not a latency measurement.

### Voice diagnostics

These commands use `{"op":"voice", ...}` and the normal main-task controller.
The generic diagnostic blue-button action does not simulate a hold; use a
physical hold or the bounded recording check below.

| Request | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `{"op":"voice","action":"open"}` | Open the replies app and request its real inbox, or show an unresolved receipt |
| `{"op":"voice","action":"status"}` | `VOICE_STATUS` stage, capability, capture, and pending-receipt metrics |
| `{"op":"voice","action":"mic_test","duration_ms":2000}` | Local microphone check; discard captured audio without upload |
| `{"op":"voice","action":"record_test","duration_ms":2000}` | Use the normal recording/upload/transcription/review flow; requires recording eligibility |
| `{"op":"voice","action":"verify_transcript","expected":"A known test phrase."}` | Compare the reviewed transcript with a known ASCII test phrase; report only match and lengths |
| `{"op":"voice","action":"cancel"}` | Leave replies for the badge through normal cancellation/receipt handling |

Both recording checks accept requested stop intervals of **500–5,000 ms**, with
a 2,000 ms default. Microphone startup can reduce the resulting audio duration.
`mic_test` requires replies mode, an idle recorder, no voice request, and no
unresolved send. It does not create a draft or contact a transcription provider.
`record_test` additionally requires an eligible live session and an inbox/review
state; it makes a real server-side transcription request after recording.
Neither diagnostic sends an X reply, and **there is no diagnostic Send action**.

`VOICE_CAPTURE` reports sample count, duration, WAV byte length, amplitude
statistics, and worker stack headroom; it does not export PCM. `VOICE_STATUS`
reports capability flags and state, not session credentials or transcript text.
Its `configured` flag means local setup succeeded, not that the gateway or any
provider was contacted successfully.

`verify_transcript` is available only in Review and accepts at most 160 bytes of
expected ASCII text. It lowercases ASCII letters, trims leading/trailing
whitespace, and collapses spaces, tabs, and line breaks before comparing.
Punctuation still matters. Non-ASCII actual text cannot match this diagnostic;
the original transcript remains unchanged. `VOICE_TRANSCRIPT` prints `match`,
`length`, and `expected_length` only. Use a known test phrase and do not add raw
transcript logging to diagnose a mismatch.

## Troubleshooting and recovery

- **Missing avatar:** distinguish missing provider connection, failed HTTPS/trust,
  rejected URL, bounded download failure, and JPEG decoding. Progressive JPEG
  support is intentional. Keep hostname verification and bearer isolation intact.
- **Slow or missed input:** inspect main-loop/worker ownership and unread USB
  output first. Do not switch back to contact-on-press touch behavior; that caused
  accidental activation. See the historical fix in [decisions.md](decisions.md).
- **Badge visible but AuthKit disconnected:** saved offline data is expected.
  Look at network/auth status independently; do not set authenticated from cache.
- **Wi-Fi setup:** use Settings and the device's local captive portal. Credentials
  belong on the device, not in chat, source, command history, or firmware assets.
- **Cache mount failure:** the code deliberately avoids reformatting after the
  first initialization attempt. An interrupted first initialization can need
  explicit repair; ordinary online/RAM operation still works. Do not add an
  unconditional format-on-error shortcut.
- **Voice request still busy after Cancel:** cancellation discards its eventual
  result; it does not retract an HTTP request already sent. HTTPS remains on the
  worker with its bounded transaction deadline. Do not free a worker-owned WAV
  buffer or start a duplicate request to work around the wait.
- **xAI transcription failed:** an explicit Deepgram choice, when offered,
  requires another recording. The prior upload was wiped; fallback never silently
  replays it. Review text is accepted only from a context-verified response.
- **Send disabled:** check the live session, original user/workspace, X reply
  permission, the gateway's reply-length validation, and complete page review.
  Being able to record or display a cached badge does not authorize posting.
- **Send result unknown after disconnect/restart:** reconnect the original user
  and workspace, then use Check status. Its GET looks up the existing receipt;
  it does not post again. Keep `voice_pending` and its key until a matching
  definitive result is received. A missing/unknown result is not permission to
  retry with a new key. If receipt storage is corrupt or cannot be cleared,
  retain it and investigate the local/gateway receipt state before recovery;
  do not erase NVS or bypass the blocked state to submit another reply.
- **Factory restoration:** a pre-modification full-flash backup exists for the
  original board. Its private location and restore notes are recorded locally.
  Restoring it replaces current applications, partitions, and saved data; it is a
  separate recovery operation, not routine flashing. Verify the backup's checksum
  and current port before using those instructions.

## Historical evidence baseline

The September 11, 2026 init-only release (`76eac2c`) compiled to **1,516,455
application bytes** with **52,808 static/global bytes**, in a 3,145,728-byte app
slot. The complete host suite passed with address/undefined-behavior sanitizers,
and upload hashes were verified.

This predates the voice app. It remains the recorded badge baseline and is not
a size, timing, installation, or hardware-verification claim for the current
voice source. New voice measurements belong in [voice-replies.md](voice-replies.md)
with their source version/date and verification limitations.

The device run checked nine normal/expanded/offline frames and 18 QR decodes
(full frame plus circular aperture). All three offline frames exactly matched
their online references. Cache startup measured **1,260 ms offline / 1,300 ms
normal**. Reconnection made three profile checks, zero avatar downloads, zero
cache writes, and three unchanged-write skips. Settings dispatch, reserved yellow,
selected-account preservation, and removal of old styles survived restart.

Private evidence is discoverable through `.local/project-context.md` when
present. Its absence on another checkout does not mean those hardware checks have
been rerun there. Preserve the version/date of these results when recording new
device evidence.
