# Native UI host checks

Run `bash tests/factory-ui/run.sh` after fetching the pinned factory dependencies.
This compiles the production page files with real LVGL, Smooth container ownership
and Mooncake lifecycle, using a memory framebuffer and a simulated pointer input.
Address/undefined-behavior sanitizers are enabled by default.

Checks cover all six pages and centered indicators while the invitation is locked
or unlocked; the exact `tap the code to reveal a secret invitation` prompt; whole-page native touch-Morse taps/holds,
complete-word callbacks, immediate code retry after an explicit relock, and cancellation on drags, press loss, page/modal changes
and rotation; noninterrupting timed reveal during agenda scrolling/modals;
the ordered three-word reveal, one-shot native GIF and cleanup on completion or
early navigation, with no replay on already-unlocked entry or timed reveal;
supplied-brand chrome and square page indicators after partial redraws; no redraws on idle
static pages; release-only buttons; drag-out-and-back, within-button drag and
long-hold cancellation for ordinary buttons (the code surface accepts holds);
real agenda text and wrapped titles/details; current/past/upcoming
styles, release-only bookmark toggles, invalid time, daily reset and preserved schedule scroll;
agenda entry and native swipe snapping center each row between the arrows within one pixel,
including the first/last rows and entries without a current session or valid clock;
settled agenda frames match a full redraw byte-for-byte after entry and endpoint swipes;
native schedule/social scrolling; dynamic profile and
avatar/company updates, social-only profiles and configured faces without chrome; QR expansion; setup return paths; and Touch test lifecycle.
They do not validate the physical sensor, display transport, or orientation HAL.
The touch-code view uses the production `MorseUnlock` timings: dots 50–349 ms,
dashes 350–1400 ms, symbol gaps 50–599 ms, letter pauses 600–2499 ms, a 2.5-second
released-idle reset and a 15-second attempt bound. Correct input completes on the
final dash release. Native dot/dash groups, letter spacing, shake/fade feedback,
immediate retry during that animation and lifecycle cleanup are checked too.
Main owns clock policy and NVS persistence;
the UI fixture observes its callback without writing a device unlock.
